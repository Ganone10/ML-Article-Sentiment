# Sentiment Analysis of Financial News Articles

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques in Python to analyze the sentiment of financial news articles. It aims to provide insights into the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of news articles related to the financial market.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on financial news articles.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters, and converting text to lowercase.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements machine learning models for sentiment analysis, including pre-trained models and custom models trained on financial news datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluates model performance using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Web Scraping (Optional):** Provides an option to scrape financial news articles from online sources for real-time sentiment analysis.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- (Optional) BeautifulSoup for web scraping

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/sentiment-analysis-financial-news.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of financial news articles in CSV format.

2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the data:

    ```
    python preprocessing.py --input_file data/financial_news.csv --output_file data/processed_financial_news.csv
    ```

3. Train the sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed data:

    ```
    python train_model.py --input_file data/processed_financial_news.csv --model_type logistic_regression --output_model models/sentiment_model.pkl
    ```

4. Evaluate the model performance:

    ```
    python evaluate_model.py --input_file data/processed_financial_news.csv --model models/sentiment_model.pkl
    ```

5. (Optional) Use the trained model for real-time sentiment analysis on new financial news articles:

    ```
    python analyze_sentiment.py --input_article "Your financial news article text here"
    ```
